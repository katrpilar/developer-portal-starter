# Image Map

This step can be used to create an image map. It is used to create different click-able areas on an image. This will allow to create a more visual experience for different approaches (selecting a parking lot, a seat at a table, etc.). Note that this is a presentational step and it is not tied down to the availability. For the example of parking lots, if a lot is selected on a previous appointment, we canâ€™t show it as taken.
